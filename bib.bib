 abstract = {We present a comprehensive survey of constructions of the real numbers (from either the rationals or the integers) in a unified fashion, thus providing an overview of most (if not all) known constructions ranging from the earliest attempts to recent results, and allowing for a simple comparison-at-a-glance between different constructions.},

 abstract = {An algorithm for the computation of the continued fraction expansions of numbers which are zeros of differentiable functions is given. The method is direct in the sense that it requires function evaluations at appropriate steps, rather than the value of the number as input in order to deliver the expansion. Statistical data on the first 10000 partial quotients for various real numbers are also given.},

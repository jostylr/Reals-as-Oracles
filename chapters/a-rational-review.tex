\chapter{A Rational Review}

\newthought{This book is} about having a strong foundation for doing calculus. A large chunk of it is with thoroughly establishing the real numbers as computable from rational numbers. It is therefore important to have as a starting point a comprehensive understanding of rational numbers which in turn relies on integers and, at base, the counting numbers. This preliminary chapter covers all of that material. 

This can be skipped entirely by every reader, but a good skimming may reveal some useful ideas. Anyone who feels uncertain about the nature of numbers is invited to read this.

\chapter{Sets as Natural Numbers}

This a more formal approach to defining natural numbers. It is not necessarily better, but it does make some people more comfortable. It makes other people less comfortable. 

The idea is to use sets to represent numbers. Sets are containers and it is possible to have an empty container, called the empty set or null set. It seems reasonable for this to exist. We will call it zero. 

Now we want to represent one. A set with one element would be a reasonable representative. But what do we have? We have the empty set. So one is the set containing the empty set. This is a jug with an empty bottle inside of it. 

The number two is the set containing both 0 and 1. It has two elements. It can be viewed as a bag containing a jug with an empty bottle as well as an empty bottle outside of the jug but in the bag.

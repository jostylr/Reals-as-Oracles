\begin{abstract}
We explore a new definition of real numbers, namely, a real number is an oracle that gives an affirmation if the real number is in a given rational interval and gives a negative if not. We establish that this is a proper definition of real numbers, compare and contrast with other common definitions, and mention some immediate algorithmic uses of them. This definition moves the real number definition to be in line with how they are pragmatically used.

\section{Introduction}


The current definitions of real numbers has some unsatisfactory aspects. This
has been explored by Norm Wildberger ....

\begin{itemize}
    \item Infinite Decimals. Arithmetic is very problematic. Infinite choice vs
  algorithm. Unlimited carries basically stop us at some point. Related to
  this are other representations of numbers, such as continued fractions. The
  main issue is that these are all based on a particular representation which
  sidesteps existence and what the thing is, but feels very comfortable from a
  numerical point of view. 
  \item Equivalence Classes of Cauchy Sequences. Arbitrarily long initial portions
  of the sequences implies that, in a finite universe such as we have, all
  Cauchy sequences classes will look the same up to any given n. Could modify
  it by requiring the difference between terms to be less than a prescribed
  term, say 1/n, for a given point in the sequence. But then one needs to
  ensure that the arithmetic works out to keep that in place. But it does deal
  with the initial idiocy. That's really bad. 
  \item Dedekind Cuts. Infinite sets, the construction is not really in line with
  how we produce or use real numbers. If one is okay with infinite sets and
  few explicit examples, then it seems like it is a foundation. 
  \item Nested Intervals. This works and is strongly related to Dedekind cuts, but
  to see it is a given sequence of nested intervals has uniqueness issues. So
  one needs a refinement, such as Cauchy sequences. Also, nothing to stop the
  same objection in Cauchy sequences in which an initial amount of the
  sequence is not specific at all. It is a little bit more controlled, but it
  could take a trillion intervals to get anywhere near the number of interest.
\end{itemize}


We propose a new definition, one which is in line with how we actually use it.
It comes with it a couple of immediate to use algorithms, but it is not an
attempt to produce a string of better approximations. It is, rather, an
attempt to give form to an approximation.

If we recast the Dedekind cut into a statement about a mapping of rational
numbers to the numbers -1, 0, 1, as we describe presently, then this
similarity of our approach becomes even more apparent: 
Indicator function of a partition of Q based on mythical r: 
R(q) = -1 if q is less than r, R(q) = 0 if q is r, and R(q) = 1 if q is
greater than r. 

We can then get away from thinking of having to produce a set for the Dedekind
cut and instead view it as something to compute when we want to know whether
we are less than or greater than a given real number. This gets us closer to a
useful description, but it still isn't quite what we are looking for. 

Our idea is that a real number is an oracle that we ask whether the real
number is in a given rational interval. We will proceed in defining this and
some of its implications. 



\section{Definition of an Oracle Rule}\label{sec:ora}

The heuristic is that the Oracle of $r$ is a rule which, given two rational numbers, will return 1 if
$r$ is in the closed interval defined by the two rational numbers and returns 0
otherwise. We sometimes refer to the 1 as a "Yes" and 0 as a "No".

To facilitate slightly easier notation, we will define a rational interval $a:b$ as giving a rational number $q$ the property of being in the interval if $q$ is between $a$ and $b$, inclusive. We identify $b:a$ as the same property. The interval $a:b$ contains the interval $c:d$ if being in the interval $c:d$ implies being in the interval $a:b$. We will write $a<b$ if we want to indicate that relation between the rationals; it is sometimes convenient to slip that into notation, but it is often not needed in which case we just use the $a:b$.

We also allow unbounded intervals. We write that as $a:\infty$ for all rationals greater than or equal to $a$ and write $a:-\infty$ for all rationals less than or equal to $a$. The special interval $-\infty:\infty$ consists of all rationals. 

A rule $R$ is an Oracle if it is defined on rational intervals, returns values of 1
and 0, and satisfies being consistent, non-vacuous, separating, rooted, and closed. 
as explained below: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consistency. If $R(a:b) = 1$, then $R(c:d) = 1$ if $c:d$ contains $a:b$. If $R(a:b)= 0$, then $R(c:d)=0$ if $c:d$ is contained in $a:b$.
    \item Non-Vacuous. $R(-\infty:\infty) = 1$.
    \item Separating. If $R(a:b)=1$, then for a given $c$ in $a:b$, either $R(c:c) = 1$ or $R(a:c) \neq R(c:b)$. 
    \item Rooted. There is at most one $c$ such that $R(c:c) =1$.
    \item Closed. If $c$ is contained in all "Yes" intervals, then $R(c:c) = 1$.
\end{enumerate}

Consistency says that "Yes" propagates upwards to larger intervals while "No" propagates downwards to smaller intervals. 

The Non-Vacuous requirement is required to avoid the trivial $R(a:b) = 0$ for all $a:b$. 

Separation is needed to ensure that the "Yes" propagates downwards and we can make a decision about which interval has $r$. This is crucial to the use of the Oracle in approximating what we take to be a single number $r$. The possibility of $R(c:c) = 1$ occurs exactly when the real number $r$ is the rational number $c$.

Being Rooted ensures that there is just one single number under discussion. Without this, we could have the rule, for example, $R(a:b) = 1$ for all $a:b$. It is a necessary extension to Separating. 

Finally, the Closed property is required to ensure that we have only one rule per rational number. Without this, we would face a similar problem to $0.\bar{9} = 1.\bar{0} = 1$ in the presentation of infinite decimals. Since our oracles are modeling having a given number present, it seems reasonable to include the rational number $c$ if it is present in all "Yes" intervals. 

Separation enables us to mostly determine when an interval is a "No" by computing a suitably small interval that is "Yes". Via the bisection method explored later, given an oracle, we can theoretically compute intervals of arbitrarily small length. If the "Yes" interval is disjoint from a given interval, then the separation implies that interval is a "No". If the "Yes" interval is contained in the other interval, then consistency demands that the given interval is "Yes". The other remaining case is that the "Yes" interval intersects the given interval and does so for all intervals computed. If we can prove that all smaller intervals intersect, then we have that the endpoint of the given interval is a "Yes" by the closed property and therefore the given interval is a "Yes". This is a major point where we encounter the usual computational difficulties of real numbers. 

This definition does not avoid all of the downsides of the other definitions of real numbers, but it does reduce them to a context that reflects how real numbers get used in practice. 


\subsection{Examples}

It is always good to start with examples. 

For the positive $n$th root of a positive rational number $q$, the Oracle rule would be $R(a<b) = 1$, if and only if $q$ is either contained in $a^n:b^n$ for $a>0$ or contained in $0:b^n$ for $a \leq 0$ and $b>0$. Because of the monotonicity of $x^n$ for positive $x$, consistency holds. The non-vacuous can be seen by the fact that $R(0:q)$ will hold. The separation property is handled by considered the case of $c^n < q$ vs $c^n > q$ vs $c^n = q$. All three cases lead to the correct outcome for that property. 

Another common example is that of an approximation scheme with an error bound. The error bound is giving us an interval in which the "Yes" should be given by the Oracle. The rule is therefore $R(a:b) = 1$ if and only if there is an approximated interval contained in $a:b$. This automatically gives consistency. A single given approximating interval establishes the non-vacuous. The separating portion requires computing an approximating interval that does the distinguishment. We can do this by computing the minimum length of $a:c$ and $c:b$ and then finding an approximating interval that is smaller than any of those lengths and does not contain $c$. This, of course, requires $c$ not to be $r$. If it is, then $R(c:c) = 1$. The usability of this rule depends on being able to determine this for a given $c$. NEED TO REVISIT THIS. 

One tricky case is where we try to define an oracle such that $R(a<c) = 1$ for all $a < c$ with $c$ fixed, but have $R(c:c) = 0$. We could also have $R(c<b) =1$ similarly and not $R(c:c) =1$

These cases do satisfy our three properties and they are distinct as they disagree. 

\subsection{Equality}

Two oracles are equal if they agree on all rational intervals. To prove inequality, it is therefore sufficient to find a disagreement. 

What we want to know is whether given two different "real numbers", do we get different oracles for them. Since we are defining real numbers, this gets a little tricky, but we can imagine that what we mean by knowing the two numbers are different is that they are separated by a rational number. Let's assume $a < r < p < s < b$ where $r$ and $s$ are our two distinct real numbers and $p$ is a known rational that separates them, and $a$ and $b$ are two rationals we know sandwich the two reals. For example, if we we want to distinguish the square roots of 2 and 3 from one another, then $a = 1$, $p = 3/2$, and $b = 2$ would suffice. By the definition of what the oracles ought to be representing, we can assume $R(a:p) = 1$, $S(p:b) = 1$, and $R(p:p) = S(p:p) = 0$, and $R(a:b)=S(a:b) = 1$. We want to find an interval on which they disagree. 

By the separation property, we must have $R(a:p) \neq R(p:b)$ and thus $R(p:b) \neq S(p:b)$. 

If we were to have oracles that are on-demand creators of the answers, maintaining consistency, then we not be able to establish two oracles being equal, only unequal. 

We define inequalities between oracles, $R < S$, as this being true if and only if there are rational intervals $a:b$ and $c:d$ such that they are disjoint and $a:b < c:d$ (all rational numbers in the left interval are less than those in the right) and $R(a:b) = 1 = S(c:d)$. Due to consistency, this will hold true on all sub-intervals. 

\subsection{Rational Embedding}

The rational oracles are exactly those who have a $R(c:c)=1$ for some rational $c$. That is the rational.

Given a rational $q$, we define the Oracle of $q$ as the rule $R(a:b) = 1$ if and only if $q$ is contained in $a:b$. 

The properties of an oracle are trivial to check in this case. 



\subsection{Least Upper Bound}

We are given a non-empty set $E$ with an upper bound $M$, meaning that every element of $x \in E$ has the property $x < M$. This is a standard setup of interest and we will assume that this is meaningful to speak of.

Define the Oracle of $\mathrm{sup} E$ to be the rule such that $R(a<b) = 1$ if $a \leq x$ for some $x \in E$ and $b \geq \alpha$ for some upper bound $\alpha$ of $E$. We add in a cheat clause that if there is a rational $q$ that is the least upper bound of the set, then we add in $R(q:q)$. This allows us to satisfy the rationally filled property. We claim that this is an oracle and that it has the property that, in the ordering given by the oracles, it is the least upper bound of $E$. 

It is non-vacuous as $R(x:M) = 1$ where $x$ is the assumed member of $E$ that exists and $M$ is the given upper bound. Consistency follows ... It is separating ... 

It is a least upper bound as any bound that would be below it, would have to be part of a "Yes" interval and thus we would have a separation and this would then be less then that (or equal). Similarly, it is above every element for the same reason. 


\section{Interval Arithmetic}

\section{Oracle Arithmetic}

doing these computations is important:

$a-a = 0$. Let $R$ be the Oracle of $a$. We want to show that $S= R-R$ is the Oracle of 0. Let $c:d$ be any $R$-Yes interval. Then $c:d-c:d = c:d+ -d:-c = c-d:d-c$ is the corresponding $S$-Yes interval. Clearly, this interval contains 0. As 0 is contained in each $S$-Yes interval, we have $S(0:0)=1$ and $S$ is the Oracle of 0. 

$\tfrac{a}{a} = 1$, for $a \neq 0$. Let $R$ be the oracle of $a$. We want to show $S=R/R$ is the Oracle of 1. Let $c:d$ be any $R$-Yes interval that does not contain 0. By the closed property, this exists because $a \neq 0$. Then $\dfrac{c:d}{c:d} = c:d * \tfrac{1}{d}:\tfrac{1}{c}$. By the definition of the multiplication, we need to consider the four products of the endpoints which are: 1, $\tfrac{d}{c}$, $\tfrac{c}{d}$, 1. This translates into the $S$-Yes interval $\tfrac{d}{c}:\tfrac{c}{d}$ which clearly contains 1. As this applies to all $R$-Yes intervals that do not include 0, we can conclude that $S(1:1) =1$.



\section{Complete Ordered Field}

To what extent this is true depends on one's attitude about infinite sets and so forth, but to the extent that the other definitions are valid, we are just as valid. ....

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the set of all oracles. 

From above, given two 

\section{Bisection Approximation}

Let $R$ be an Oracle of $r$. We will use $R$ to compute an approximation of $r$ to any desired level of accuracy.

$R$ being non-vacuous gives us a starting interval, say $a:b$ with length $L$. Then take $c = \frac{a+b}{2}$. Since $R$ is separating, we can use it to determine whether $R(a:c) = 1$ or $R(c:b) = 1$ or $R(c:c) = 1$. If it is the latter, we are done and $r = c$. If it is one of the former, then we use that new interval to repeat the same process, but the length of the interval is now $\frac{L}{2}$. 

If we do this $n$ times, then the length will be $\frac{L}{2^n}$ which allows us to compute $r$ to be within any level of given accuracy. 

This is the bisection method, of course, and oracles provide exactly what we need to use it.

\section{Concluding Thoughts}

Our definition is designed to be a tool for using the number. Some of the other definitions are designed at giving the approximations as the number. This definition resists doing so because of the issue of uniqueness and not having to actually make all those choices. 

An alternative definition could have been to have a function that given a rational epsilon, we get an interval. Again, this would be problematic for us having to define the interval amongst many choices. A unique oracle per real number is very useful. It also helps with defining the arithmetic.

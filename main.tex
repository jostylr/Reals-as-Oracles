\begin{abstract}
We explore a new definition of real numbers, namely, a real number is an oracle that gives an affirmation if the real number is in a given rational interval and gives a negative if not. We establish that this is a proper definition of real numbers, compare and contrast with other common definitions, and mention some immediate algorithmic uses of them. This definition moves the real number definition to be in line with how they are pragmatically used.

\section{Introduction}


The current definitions of real numbers has some unsatisfactory aspects. This
has been explored by Norm Wildberger ....

\begin{itemize}
    \item Infinite Decimals. Arithmetic is very problematic. Infinite choice vs
  algorithm. Unlimited carries basically stop us at some point. Related to
  this are other representations of numbers, such as continued fractions. The
  main issue is that these are all based on a particular representation which
  sidesteps existence and what the thing is, but feels very comfortable from a
  numerical point of view. 
  \item Equivalence Classes of Cauchy Sequences. Arbitrarily long initial portions
  of the sequences implies that, in a finite universe such as we have, all
  Cauchy sequences classes will look the same up to any given n. Could modify
  it by requiring the difference between terms to be less than a prescribed
  term, say 1/n, for a given point in the sequence. But then one needs to
  ensure that the arithmetic works out to keep that in place. But it does deal
  with the initial idiocy. That's really bad. 
  \item Dedekind Cuts. Infinite sets, the construction is not really in line with
  how we produce or use real numbers. If one is okay with infinite sets and
  few explicit examples, then it seems like it is a foundation. 
  \item Nested Intervals. This works and is strongly related to Dedekind cuts, but
  to see it is a given sequence of nested intervals has uniqueness issues. So
  one needs a refinement, such as Cauchy sequences. Also, nothing to stop the
  same objection in Cauchy sequences in which an initial amount of the
  sequence is not specific at all. It is a little bit more controlled, but it
  could take a trillion intervals to get anywhere near the number of interest.
\end{itemize}


We propose a new definition, one which is in line with how we actually use it.
It comes with it a couple of immediate to use algorithms, but it is not an
attempt to produce a string of better approximations. It is, rather, an
attempt to give form to an approximation.

If we recast the Dedekind cut into a statement about a mapping of rational
numbers to the numbers -1, 0, 1, as we describe presently, then this
similarity of our approach becomes even more apparent: 
Indicator function of a partition of Q based on mythical r: 
R(q) = -1 if q is less than r, R(q) = 0 if q is r, and R(q) = 1 if q is
greater than r. 

We can then get away from thinking of having to produce a set for the Dedekind
cut and instead view it as something to compute when we want to know whether
we are less than or greater than a given real number. This gets us closer to a
useful description, but it still isn't quite what we are looking for. 

Our idea is that a real number is an oracle that we ask whether the real
number is in a given rational interval. We will proceed in defining this and
some of its implications. 



\section{Definition of an Oracle Rule}\label{sec:ora}

The heuristic is that the Oracle of $r$ is a rule which, given two rational numbers, will return 1 if
$r$ is in the closed interval defined by the two rational numbers and returns 0
otherwise. We sometimes refer to the 1 as a "Yes" and 0 as a "No".

To facilitate slightly easier notation, we will define a rational interval $a:b$ as giving a rational number $q$ the property of being in the interval if $q$ is between $a$ and $b$, inclusive. We identify $b:a$ as the same property. The interval $a:b$ contains the interval $c:d$ if being in the interval $c:d$ implies being in the interval $a:b$. We will write $a<b$ if we want to indicate that relation between the rationals; it is sometimes convenient to slip that into notation, but it is often not needed in which case we just use the $a:b$.

We also allow unbounded intervals. We write that as $a:\infty$ for all rationals greater than or equal to $a$ and write $a:-\infty$ for all rationals less than or equal to $a$. The special interval $-\infty:\infty$ consists of all rationals. 

A rule $R$ is an Oracle if it is defined on rational intervals, returns values of 1
and 0, and satisfies being consistent, non-vacuous, separating, rooted, and closed. 
as explained below: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consistency. If $R(a:b) = 1$, then $R(c:d) = 1$ if $c:d$ contains $a:b$. If $R(a:b)= 0$, then $R(c:d)=0$ if $c:d$ is contained in $a:b$.
    \item Non-Vacuous. $R(-\infty:\infty) = 1$.
    \item Separating. If $R(a:b)=1$, then for a given $c \neq a, b$ in $a:b$, either $R(c:c) = 1$ or $R(a:c) \neq R(c:b)$. 
    \item Rooted. There is at most one $c$ such that $R(c:c) =1$.
    \item Closed. If $c$ is contained in all "Yes" intervals, then $R(c:c) = 1$.
\end{enumerate}

Consistency says that "Yes" propagates upwards to larger intervals while "No" propagates downwards to smaller intervals. 

The Non-Vacuous requirement is required to avoid the trivial $R(a:b) = 0$ for all $a:b$. 

Separation is needed to ensure that the "Yes" propagates downwards and we can make a decision about which interval has $r$. This is crucial to the use of the Oracle in approximating what we take to be a single number $r$. The possibility of $R(c:c) = 1$ occurs exactly when the real number $r$ is the rational number $c$.

\begin{remark}
Separation could alternatively be phrased as insisting that if $a,b,c, R$ are as in that property with $R(a:b) = 1$, then at least one of $R(a:c)$ or $R(c:b)$ is 1 and if they are both 1, then $R(c:c) = 1$. 
\end{remark}


Being Rooted ensures that there is just one single number under discussion. Without this, we could have the rule, for example, $R(a:b) = 1$ for all $a:b$. It is a necessary extension to Separating. 

Finally, the Closed property is required to ensure that we have only one rule per rational number. Without this, we would face a similar problem to $0.\bar{9} = 1.\bar{0} = 1$ in the presentation of infinite decimals. Since our oracles are modeling having a given number present, it seems reasonable to include the rational number $c$ if it is present in all "Yes" intervals. 

Separation enables us to mostly determine when an interval is a "No" by computing a suitably small interval that is "Yes". Via the bisection method explored later, given an oracle, we can theoretically compute intervals of arbitrarily small length. If the "Yes" interval is disjoint from a given interval, then the separation implies that interval is a "No". If the "Yes" interval is contained in the other interval, then consistency demands that the given interval is "Yes". The other remaining case is that the "Yes" interval intersects the given interval and does so for all intervals computed. If we can prove that all smaller intervals intersect, then we have that the endpoint of the given interval is a "Yes" by the closed property and therefore the given interval is a "Yes". This is a major point where we encounter the usual computational difficulties of real numbers. 

This definition does not avoid all of the downsides of the other definitions of real numbers, but it does reduce them to a context that reflects how real numbers get used in practice. 

\subsection{ Intersections and Unions}

Let $a \leq b \leq c \leq d$. The intersection of $a:c$ and $b:d$ is $c:d$ while the union is $a:d$. One can either take those as statements from the usual set definitions or take these as the definitions of those terms. It is immediate from the Consistency property that Yes-intervals are closed under unions and that No-intervals are closed under intersection. We will prove that they closed under intersections and unions, respectively. 

We start with establishing that the intersection of two $R$-Yes intervals is an $R$-Yes interval.

\begin{proposition}
Let $R$ be an oracle and $a \leq b \leq c \leq d$. If $R(a:c) = 1 = R(b:d)$, then $R(b:c) = 1$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  
  This follows from the Separation and Consistency properties. From Consistency, we have $R(a:d) = 1$ since it contains an $R$-Yes interval (two in fact, but we just need one). Then apply separation to $a:c$ and $c:d$. If $R(c:c) = 1$, then $R(b:c) = 1$ since it contains $c:c$ and we are done. Otherwise, Separation tells us $R(a:c) \neq R(c:d)$. By assumption, we know $R(a:c) = 1$ so that implies $R(c:d) = 1$. We can then consider $R(b:d) = 1$ and consider the Separation based on $c$ $R(b:c) \neq R(c:d)$ since we are specifically in the case that $R(c:c) \neq 1$. Since we established $R(c:d) = 0$, we must have $R(b:c) = 1$ and we have established that Yes-intervals are closed under intersections. 
\end{proof}

For No-intervals, the opposite conclusion holds. Let's establish that the No-intervals are closed under union. 

\begin{proposition}
Let $R$ be an oracle and $a \leq b \leq c \leq d$.  If $R(a:c) = 0$ and $R(b:d) = 0$, then $R(a:d) = 0$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let's assume that $R(a:d) = 1$ and find a contradiction. With that assumption, $R(a:b) = 1$ from Separation applied to $a:b$ and $b:d$ with the fact that $b:d$ was a No-interval. But this contradicts $R(a:c)= 0$ since it contains $a:b$ and therefore $a:c$ must be a Yes-interval.
\end{proof}

Also, two disjoint intervals cannot be both yes. 

\begin{proposition}
Let $R$ be an oracle and $a \leq b < c \leq d$. Then we must have at least either $R(a:b) = 0$ or $R(c:d) = 0$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Assume, for contradiction, that $R(a:b) = R(c:d) = 1$. By Consistency, $R(a:d) = 1$. Then Separation applies. At least either $R(b:b) = 0$ or $R(c:c) = 0$. Let's assume $R(b:b) = 0$ without loss of generality. Then $R(a:b) \neq R(b:d)$. But $R(a:b) = 1$ by assumption. So $R(b:d) = 0$. But we assumed $R(c:d) = 1$ and that is contained in $b:d$ which implies, by Consistency, that $R(b:d) = 1$. Thus, we have arrived at the contradiction $0 = R(b:d) = 1$. 
\end{proof}


\subsection{Examples}

It is always good to start with examples. 

For the positive $n$th root of a positive rational number $q$, the Oracle rule would be $R(a<b) = 1$, if and only if $q$ is either contained in $a^n:b^n$ for $a>0$ or contained in $0:b^n$ for $a \leq 0$ and $b>0$. Because of the monotonicity of $x^n$ for positive $x$, consistency holds. The non-vacuous can be seen by the fact that $R(0:q)$ will hold. The separation property is handled by considered the case of $c^n < q$ vs $c^n > q$ vs $c^n = q$. All three cases lead to the correct outcome for that property. 

Another common example is that of an approximation scheme with an error bound. The error bound is giving us an interval in which the "Yes" should be given by the Oracle. The rule is therefore $R(a:b) = 1$ if and only if there is an approximated interval contained in $a:b$. This automatically gives consistency. A single given approximating interval establishes the non-vacuous. The separating portion requires computing an approximating interval that does the distinguishment. We can do this by computing the minimum length of $a:c$ and $c:b$ and then finding an approximating interval that is smaller than any of those lengths and does not contain $c$. This, of course, requires $c$ not to be $r$. If it is, then $R(c:c) = 1$. The usability of this rule depends on being able to determine this for a given $c$. NEED TO REVISIT THIS. 

One tricky case is where we try to define an oracle such that $R(a<c) = 1$ for all $a < c$ with $c$ fixed, but have $R(c:c) = 0$. We could also have $R(c<b) =1$ similarly and not $R(c:c) =1$

These cases do satisfy our three properties and they are distinct as they disagree. 

\subsection{Equality}

Two oracles are equal if they agree on all rational intervals. To prove inequality, it is therefore sufficient to find a disagreement. 

What we want to know is whether given two different "real numbers", do we get different oracles for them. Since we are defining real numbers, this gets a little tricky, but we can imagine that what we mean by knowing the two numbers are different is that they are separated by a rational number. Let's assume $a < r < p < s < b$ where $r$ and $s$ are our two distinct real numbers and $p$ is a known rational that separates them, and $a$ and $b$ are two rationals we know sandwich the two reals. For example, if we we want to distinguish the square roots of 2 and 3 from one another, then $a = 1$, $p = 3/2$, and $b = 2$ would suffice. By the definition of what the oracles ought to be representing, we can assume $R(a:p) = 1$, $S(p:b) = 1$, and $R(p:p) = S(p:p) = 0$, and $R(a:b)=S(a:b) = 1$. We want to find an interval on which they disagree. 

By the separation property, we must have $R(a:p) \neq R(p:b)$ and thus $R(p:b) \neq S(p:b)$. 

If we were to have oracles that are on-demand creators of the answers, maintaining consistency, then we not be able to establish two oracles being equal, only unequal. 

We define inequalities between oracles, $R < S$, as this being true if and only if there are rational intervals $a:b$ and $c:d$ such that they are disjoint and $a:b < c:d$ (all rational numbers in the left interval are less than those in the right) and $R(a:b) = 1 = S(c:d)$. Due to consistency, this will hold true on all sub-intervals. 

\subsection{Rational Embedding}

The rational oracles are exactly those who have a $R(c:c)=1$ for some rational $c$. That is the rational.

Given a rational $q$, we define the Oracle of $q$ as the rule $R(a:b) = 1$ if and only if $q$ is contained in $a:b$. 

The properties of an oracle are trivial to check in this case. 



\subsection{Least Upper Bound}

We are given a non-empty set $E$ with an upper bound $M$, meaning that every element of $x \in E$ has the property $x < M$. This is a standard setup of interest and we will assume that this is meaningful to speak of.

Define the Oracle of $\mathrm{sup} E$ to be the rule such that $R(a<b) = 1$ if $a \leq x$ for some $x \in E$ and $b \geq \alpha$ for some upper bound $\alpha$ of $E$. We add in a cheat clause that if there is a rational $q$ that is the least upper bound of the set, then we add in $R(q:q)$. This allows us to satisfy the rationally filled property. We claim that this is an oracle and that it has the property that, in the ordering given by the oracles, it is the least upper bound of $E$. 

It is non-vacuous as $R(x:M) = 1$ where $x$ is the assumed member of $E$ that exists and $M$ is the given upper bound. Consistency follows ... It is separating ... 

It is a least upper bound as any bound that would be below it, would have to be part of a "Yes" interval and thus we would have a separation and this would then be less then that (or equal). Similarly, it is above every element for the same reason. 


\section{Interval Arithmetic}

This section is not novel, but rather a review of applying arithmetic to intervals. We will need this in defining the arithmetic of oracles. This material can be seen, for example, in the videos by NJ Wildberger... These are of interest as this helps us propagate error intervals in scientific computations and our oracle approach reflects the usefulness of this thinking. 

Let $a<b$ and $c<d$, all of them being rational numbers. Then we define:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Addition. $a:b + c:d = (a+c):(b+d)$
    \item Negation. $-(a:b) = -b:-a$
    \item Subtraction. $a:b - c:d = a:b + (-c:d) = a-d:b-c$
    \item Multiplication. If $0<a<b$ and $0<c<d$, then $a:b*c:d = ac:bd$. Otherwise, $a:b * c:d = \mathrm{min}(ac, ad, bc, bd): \mathrm{max}(ac,ad,bc,bd)$
    \item Reciprocity. $1/(a:b) = 1/b:1/a$. If 0 is contained in $a:b$, then the reciprocal is undefined as it actually generates $-\infty:1/a$ and $1/b:\infty$. 
    \item Division. $(a:b) / (c:d) = a:b * 1/d:1/c$. This is only defined if 0 is not contained in $c:d$.
    \item Powers. Let $n$ be a natural number. $(a:b)^n = a^n:b^n$ for $0 < a < b$. If at least one of them is negative, then let $c = \mathrm{max} (|a|, |b|)$ and $d=\mathrm{min}(|a|, |b|)$. Then $(a:b)^n = c^n: c^{n-1}d$. 
\end{enumerate}

Subtraction, Division, and Powers, all follow from the usual combination of the previous defined operations. 

As an example of the powers, consider $(-2:3)^4$. All of the products of the endpoints are: $16, -24, 36, -54, 81$. We therefore have the interval being $-54:81$ which is the product of $ab^3$ and $b^4$. 

NEED TO ENSURE OPERATIONS ARE INTERVALS, see division ....  
Also need to argue that this is given two rationals contained in, then their arithmetic gets into the right interval. 

\subsection{Verifying the rules}

The associative and commutative rules of arithmetic apply to intervals. The distributive rule somewhat applies. Each of these is a distinct computation, but very straightforward. We will do the distributive property separately. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Interval addition is closed, namely, the sum of two intervals is another interval by definition. 
    \item Addition is Commutative. $a:b + c:d= a+c : b+d = c+a:b+d = c:d + a:b$. We used the commutativity of rational addition in the middle step. 
    \item Addition is Associative. $(a:b + c:d) + e:f = (a+c:b+d)+e:f = ((a+c)+e:(b+d)+f) = (a+c+e:b+d+f$ where the last step is the associative property of rationals.  On the other hand, $a:b + (c:d+e:f) = a:b + (c+e:d+f) = a+(c+e):b+(d+f) = a+c+e:b+d+f$ again by associativity of addition of rationals. Since they are equal to the same quantity, we have the associative rule of addition applying to intervals and we can comfortably write $a:b + c:d + e:f$ without requiring parentheses. 
    \item $0:0$ is the additive identity as $a:b+0:0 = a+0:b+0 = a:b$. 
    \item There is no additive inverse since subtraction increases the length of the interval. The singleton intervals do have additive inverses. 
    \item Interval multiplication is closed, namely, the product of two intervals is another interval by definition. 
    \item Multiplication is Commutative. $a:b * c:d= ac : bd = ca:bd = c:d * a:b$. We used the commutativity of rational multiplication in the middle step. 
    \item Multiplication is Associative. $(a:b * c:d) * e:f = (ac:bd)*e:f = ((ac)e:(bd)f) = (ace:bdf$ where the last step is the associative property of rational multiplication.  On the other hand, $a:b * (c:d*e:f) = a:b * (ce:df) = a(ce):b(df) = ace:bdf$ again by associativity of multiplication of rationals. Since they are equal to the same quantity, we have the associative rule of modification applying to intervals and we can comfortably write $a:b * c:d * e:f$ without requiring parentheses.     
    \item $1:1$ is the multiplicative identity as $a:b*1:1 = a1:b1 = a:b$. 
    \item There is no multiplicative inverse as multiplication has a non-zero length for non-singleton intervals. The non-zero singleton intervals do have multiplicative inverses. 
\end{enumerate}

The DISTRIBUTIVE Property. ...

\subsection{Lengths}

It is of some interest to compute out the lengths of these intervals that are generated by the arithmetic. We often want to have the lengths be as small as possible. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $a:b + c:d$ has length $(b+d) - (a+c) = (b-a) + (d-c)$, that is, it is the length of the two intervals separately. 
    \item $a:b*c:d$ for positive endpoints is $bd-ac = bd -bc + bc -ac =  b(d-c) + c(b-a)$ though it is also equal to $bd - ad + ad - ac = d(b-a) + a(d-c)$. For mixed signs, we have the maximum of $|a(d-c)|$, $|b(d-c)|$, $|c(b-a)|$, $|d(b-a)|$, $|d(b-a)+a(d-c)| = |b(d-c) + c(b-a)|$.  CHECK
    \item Negation does not change the interval length. 
    \item Subtraction has length $b-c - (a-d) = (d-c) + (b-a)$, the same as addition.
    \item Reciprocity. $1/a - 1/b = \tfrac{b-a}{ab}$. Note $a$ and $b$ must be the same sign to avoid having 0 in there, which was part of the definition. 
    \item DIVISION
    \item POWERS
\end{enumerate}

For a simple bounding estimate on the multiplicative length, we can take the maximum $M$ of $|a|, |b|, |c|, |d|$ and multiply that by the maximum length $L$ of $b-a$ and $d-c$ and then double that. So $2*M*L$.  CHECK 


\section{Oracle Arithmetic}


Checking $R+S=T$ is a rule. Specifically, any interval $a:b$ is a YES interval if and only if it contains, possibly is, a sum interval from $R$ and $S$' s YES interval. If a rational number $q$ is part of every such YES interval, then $R(q:q) = 1$. 

Consistency is by definition. 

Non-vacuous is clear as $\infty:\infty$ adds to itself. 

Rooted. Assume there is $p<q$, both rational, such that $T(p:p)=1$ and $T(q:q) =1$. Let $L$ be $q-p$. Take an $R$-interval and an $S$-interval of length $L/3$. Then the sum interval is less than $L$ and therefore cannot contain both $p$ and $q$. Since at least one of them is not part of a YES interval, by definition, that one is not YES.  .... 

Closed. This holds by definition. We are essentially cheating by closing it. 

Separating. This is the hard one and where the real work is. Let $T(a:b) = 1$, which means that it contains an interval which is additive, say $c:d$. Let $q$ be given in $a:b$ as the dividing point. If $T(q:q) = 1$, then we are done. So we can assume that is not the case. We therefore have to establish that $T(a:q)=1$ or $T(q:b) = 1$. If $c:d$ does not contain $q$, then it is wholly contained in either $a:q$ or $q:b$ and thus one of them is YES. The other is no because .... Assume a sum interval is in $q:b$. Look at those intervals, they must be disjoint from the other ones? So then that contradicts R, S being rules. 

If $q$ is contained in $c:d$, then there must exist a sum interval $e:f$ which $q$ is not a part of since we are assuming $T(q:q)=0$. Take the intersection of the underlying summand intervals and then add. That is an interval which will not contain $q$ but will be contained in one of them. So back to the previous one. 



doing these computations is important:

The Oracle of 0 is the additive identity

$a-a = 0$. Let $R$ be the Oracle of $a$. We want to show that $S= R-R$ is the Oracle of 0. Let $c:d$ be any $R$-Yes interval. Then $c:d-c:d = c:d+ -d:-c = c-d:d-c$ is the corresponding $S$-Yes interval. Clearly, this interval contains 0. As 0 is contained in each $S$-Yes interval, we have $S(0:0)=1$ and $S$ is the Oracle of 0. 

The Oracle of 1 is the multiplicative identity

$\tfrac{a}{a} = 1$, for $a \neq 0$. Let $R$ be the oracle of $a$. We want to show $S=R/R$ is the Oracle of 1. Let $c:d$ be any $R$-Yes interval that does not contain 0. By the closed property, this exists because $a \neq 0$. Then $\dfrac{c:d}{c:d} = c:d * \tfrac{1}{d}:\tfrac{1}{c}$. By the definition of the multiplication, we need to consider the four products of the endpoints which are: 1, $\tfrac{d}{c}$, $\tfrac{c}{d}$, 1. This translates into the $S$-Yes interval $\tfrac{d}{c}:\tfrac{c}{d}$ which clearly contains 1. As this applies to all $R$-Yes intervals that do not include 0, we can conclude that $S(1:1) =1$.



\section{Complete Ordered Field}

To what extent this is true depends on one's attitude about infinite sets and so forth, but to the extent that the other definitions are valid, we are just as valid. ....

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the set of all oracles. 

From above, given two 

\section{Bisection Approximation}

Let $R$ be an Oracle of $r$. We will use $R$ to compute an approximation of $r$ to any desired level of accuracy.

$R$ being non-vacuous gives us a starting interval, say $a:b$ with length $L$. Then take $c = \frac{a+b}{2}$. Since $R$ is separating, we can use it to determine whether $R(a:c) = 1$ or $R(c:b) = 1$ or $R(c:c) = 1$. If it is the latter, we are done and $r = c$. If it is one of the former, then we use that new interval to repeat the same process, but the length of the interval is now $\frac{L}{2}$. 

If we do this $n$ times, then the length will be $\frac{L}{2^n}$ which allows us to compute $r$ to be within any level of given accuracy. 

This is the bisection method, of course, and oracles provide exactly what we need to use it.

\section{Concluding Thoughts}

Our definition is designed to be a tool for using the number. Some of the other definitions are designed at giving the approximations as the number. This definition resists doing so because of the issue of uniqueness and not having to actually make all those choices. 

An alternative definition could have been to have a function that given a rational epsilon, we get an interval. Again, this would be problematic for us having to define the interval amongst many choices. A unique oracle per real number is very useful. It also helps with defining the arithmetic.
